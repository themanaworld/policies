This is the general Privacy Policy for The Mana World Project ("we", "us"), along
all its services, including websites, forums, wikis, repositories and game servers;
Containing information regarding the types of information that is collected and
recorded by us. If you have additional questions or require more information about
our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at legal@themanaworld.org

This Privacy Policy does not extend to third party services we may host, such as
guild websites; Please refer to their privacy policies instead.

## Consent

By using any of our services, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree
to its terms.

## Information we collect

Our services may collect standard traffic information in log files, such as your
Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser or client type, Internet Service Provider
(ISP), date and time stamp, and requested resource/page; Both in order to prevent
our services from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, to find and prevent fraud, to
analyze trends, and to better administer and maintain our services.

Some of our services which are used in conjunction with other service, such as IRC
Bots used in conjunction with IRC, or game bots used in conjunction of the game,
may further log timestamps for the last seen of nicknames or hold private
messages for users. Typically, these will be using the same permission scopes
which a regular user of the IRC Network and/or game would be have access to.
Typically, these sub-services do not enjoy any additional data collection
privileges apart from being optionally exempt from some anti-flooding policies and
being under our direct control in case of the need for assistance regarding their
usage.

Our services typically offer the users "accounts", which they may register
provided your consent and acceptance of this Privacy Policy and our terms of use.

Do note that some services like repositories, wikis and forums may collect data
subject to the DMCA under an irrevocable license terms, such as the GNU General
Public License version 2 or later. This Privacy Policy does not supersede nor
prevail over the license terms, except when required by law.

### Information TMW Forums collect

To create an account, you need to provide an username, email, and a password
(which will be stored in a hashed form). The forum uses standard TLS to protect
your information from Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks.

Creating an account will prompt the creation of defaults and storing of further
personal data automatically, such as registration date and IP, logs on the actions
performed within the forums, language, forum theme, timezone, date format, posting
preferences, display options and team memberships. They are stored to provide you
functionality, to improve and personalize your user experience, to communicate
with you, and to find and prevent fraud.

When registering or posting in our forums, we may share your username, email and/or
IP address with privacy-respecting third-parties in order to protect our website
from spambots, such as Spamhaus or Stop Forum Spam. By registering, you consent in
this sharing. The services we use may change at any time and without prior notice;
However, you may request us this information at any time you desire.

You may optionally provide profile data, such as birthday, contact, avatars,
signature, and attachments, to be shared with the public.

The accounts created at the forums will be kept until termination, as defined by
the Terms of Service. Personal data may be deleted upon request, however, forum
posts will be anonymized or pseudo-anonymized. Logs may be kept to protect the
rights of the other users from the forum and the legit interests of the board
administration, such as to find and prevent abuse or activity connected to abuse.

If you sign up for a team membership, do note that a different agreement may apply
to you.

### Information TMW Wiki collects

The wiki does not allow edits from unregistered users. To create an account, you
need to provide an email, username, a password which will be stored in a hashed
form, and it will automatically log the IP and timestamp of the registration.
Optionally, you may also provide your real name for attribution purposes.

You are also required to provide a biography of at least 200 characters, which is
public. The account creation is a manual process and will have manual review.

You may request by email to have your account terminated and the personal data
removed, which will prompt anonymization or pseudo-anonymization of your username.

When contributing, you grant us a special license described at the footer of the
wiki website, or at the submission form. This license will cover the entirety of
your contribution, including edit messages, and shall take precedence and priority
over this Privacy Policy and the rights connected to it. The biography field is
also subject to this special license.

Several actions on the wiki are logged and these logs are often kept public. You
can see which logs are enabled in the Special pages. Several actions require a
special team membership or wiki authority, which may be ruled by a different
agreement than this one.

### Information TMW Vault collects

The Mana World Vault collects registration date, IP, email, a hashed password, any
two factor authentication (2FA) secret, credentials for game accounts, ban state,
settings and variables from multiple worlds, to provide functionality to you.

In this context, a world is a game server, but it may have unique characteristics.

TMW Vault allows you to connect to worlds which may or may not be controlled by
The Mana World Team. If you decide to use TMW Vault to connect to a world, it will
share the variables scope and your Vault ID, but it will not share your email,
password, or 2FA secret.

Requesting your Vault account termination will grant us an authorization to also
terminate any sub-account connected to the Vault on your behalf. Therefore, you do
not need to send GDPR requests to each world you used TMW Vault to connect to.

The data collected by TMW Vault is strictly used to identify, contact, or provide
authentication functionality for you.

### Information our git repositories collects

The git repositories have their own privacy policies and terms of uses. When
contributing to a The Mana World repository, you may be asked for the nickname
and/or real name for attribution. This attribution will be added to the git
history and cannot be removed. Rectification may be possible via the mailmap file,
however, different git implementations may ignore this file.

Therefore, please be mindful on how you want to be attributed for git
contributions as it is a mostly irreversible process.

### Information our IRC Bot collect

Our IRC bot uses Limnoria. You may create accounts with it, which will collect
usernames, passwords, hostmasks and settings. It provide its own controls for the
personal data it collects, which should be available at Limnoria's documentation.

You do not need to create an account in order to use Limnoria. The data it
collects, such as messages sent to it, serve to prevent abuse, and to protect
other users from misusing the bot.

Do note that anyone can bring an IRC bot, and we may, but are not required to
keep track of these bots in our channels.

### Information our Game bots collects

Any user may write a game bot and connect it to our game. Said bot may collect
public data to provide its own functionality. We may, but are not required to
keep track of these bots.

Our game bots may collect public information shared with clients like your
nickname, and the time you were online (via access list protocol). They may also
collect other data to provide functionality, such as access lists and sales.

### Information our game servers collect

Our Evol2-based servers collect character data, like inventory, quest data, level,
experience, creation date, number of deaths, skill usage, and several others to
provide functionality. Character data is bound to the account and will be deleted
when the account is terminated.

Do note it shares your online activity with others, and you cannot opt-out from
this. While Game Masters may be able to disguise their online activity, this
compromises the functionality of the game, being acceptable for moderation
purposes but not for regular gameplay.

It may also optionally collect gender, partner (if married), party, guild, clan,
birthday, pincode, pets, homunculus, character names, and other data, also to
provide functionality and regular gameplay.

To create an account, you may use TMW Vault or register directly in a supported
game client. Direct registration may lead your personal data to be saved without
the use of modern encryption or security measures, therefore, it is strongly
advised to use the vault instead. Accounts created with the vault use a token
instead of a password to communicate with the game server, which provide better
protection given its one-time nature. Do note all communication with the game
server happens over plain HTTP.

Additionally, the game servers may or may not log chat, which is deleted within
a week, and the game servers also log other actions such as trade logs for a few
months. Other logs, such as authentication logs, are kept for longer.

Do note that game staff is subject to a different agreement than this privacy
policy, as most administrative or moderation actions are logged and made available
for the public.

Non evol2-based servers does not support token-based authentication, and cannot
be used with TMW Vault as a consequence.

## Public Data and User Generated Content (UGC)

affiliated with The Mana World Team, including bots. This includes User Generated
Content (UGC), which is available in most of our services and subject to
moderation.

extend to individuals including bots which may have harvested the public available
data, such as the Internet Archive or our bots.
