# Terms of Service

The present terms of service constitute the agreement between you and us, The Mana
World, also referred as "TMW", "we", "team", "TMWT", "our" and "The Mana World Team",
regarding the use of our services by you. Our services include, but are not
limited to, game servers, IRC channels, forums and wiki.

Keep in mind that we may provide links or even host third-party services, which
will be subject to their own Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

## Our rights

TMW retains the right to moderate communications within the services to the extent
it sees fit. This includes the ability to restrict your access to our services.
TMW may also take any additional steps it deem necessary in order to prevent
abuse, always respecting your privacy as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.themanaworld.org/privacy-policy).

All data collected and associated with the usage of The Mana World is held under the
stewardship of The Mana World Team (TMWT), which shall abide to the project's [Constitution](https://policies.themanaworld.org/constitution).

## Your agreement

You agree to not use our services to propagate any abusive, obscene, vulgar,
slanderous, hateful, threatening, racist, sexually-orientated or any other material that may violate any laws be it of your country, the country where
"The Mana World" is hosted or International Law. You also agree to don't share
material or content which is not owned by you, or which you do not have the
rights to share.

You agree to follow all the rules applicable to you, including but not limited to
the [Game Rules](https://policies.themanaworld.org/rules). The Mana World may,
but is not required to, monitor the use of our services to ensure the rules are
being followed, always in compliance with the [Privacy Policy](https://policies.themanaworld.org/privacy-policy).

You also agree to not use our services in a way that could be disruptive to the
other users, nor to engage in data theft, phishing attempts, identity theft, DDoS
attempts, and to not attempt to obtain undue advantage from any bugs or glitches
which our services may have.

Shall you find a bug or glitch in our services which could have given you an undue
advantage, you agree to report it as soon as you acquire knowledge of the bug,
and stop using said bug unless requested in writing by the staff to aid with
correcting the bug (assuming you agree with this request). We agree to not hold
you responsible for accidentally using the bug prior to finding out the faulty
behavior and subsequently reporting it; however, we reserve ourselves the right to
revert your data to a state prior to the bug affecting you.

## Your rights

You have the right to use our services in accordance to this policy and
sub-policies such as game rules, as well as to exercise any right granted to you
by the General Data Protection Act (GDPR), as outlined by our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.themanaworld.org/privacy-policy).

## Software Licenses

The Mana World is an open source software, and you can use it as established by
its license. Likewise, any contribution you make to the project must be in
accordance to the licenses The Mana World adopts.

## NO WARRANTY

The Mana World provides no warranties for the services, to the extend permitted by
applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders, TMW,
and/or other parties provide the services "as is" without warranty of any kind,
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of any programs offered by us is with you. Should the
program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
correction. Furthermore, we make no guarantees regarding availability or
operability of our services.

On no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any
copyright holder, The Mana World Team, or any other party who modifies and/or 
conveys the services, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
services (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the services
to operate with any other programs or services), even if such holder or other party
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## NO WAIVER

Failure from The Mana World in exercising any right from this agreement does not
constitute a waiver of such right.

## Duration and Termination

This agreement shall remain in full force and effects until you request the
termination of your account, with means provided by us or by email.

We may also unilaterally terminate this agreement if you breach this, or any
other, policy; with or without prior warning.

We, at our own discretion, may remove unused accounts to keep our systems clean
and to better protect your privacy ("purge"). In this case, we will provide a
prior notice in game, on forums and on IRC about this.

## Changes to this policy

We may change this policy at any time and for any reason. A notice in game, on the
forums and on IRC will be given every time there is a modification.

## Disputes, Governing Law and Severability

This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of
America. The parties shall endeavor to settle any dispute that arises by direct
negotiation using the [Court House sub-forum](https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewforum.php?f=20)
or email, but shall it not result in a resolution of the dispute, it shall be
resolved by a court in the New York State.

If any of the provisions on this agreement are proven unenforceable or void for
any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and
such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the 
objectives of such provision.
